## Classification - Part A Introduction
This project aims at building neural networks to classify the Cardiotocography dataset containing measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features on 2126 cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians. The objective is to **design a feedforward neural network that classifies the fetal cardiotocograms according to the fetal state class code** (N= normal; S=suspect; P=pathologic).

## Regression - Part B Introduction

This project uses the data from the Graduate Admissions Predication. The dataset contains several parameters like GRE score (out of 340), TOEFL score (out of 120), university Rating (out of 5), strengths of
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation (out of 5), undergraduate GPA (out of 10), research experience (either 0 or 1), that are considered important during the application for Master Programs. The objective is to **design a feedforward neural network that predicts the probability of a student
getting admitted into the masterâ€™s program**. The predicted parameter is the chance of getting an admit. (ranging from 0 to 1)
